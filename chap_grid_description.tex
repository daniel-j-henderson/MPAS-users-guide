\chapter{Grid Description}
\label{chap:mpas_grid_description}

This chapter provides a brief introduction to the common types of grids used in the MPAS framework. 

\section{Horizontal grid}

The MPAS grid system requires the definition of seven elements. These seven elements are composed of two types of {\it cells}, two types of {\it lines}, and three types of {\it points}. These elements are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:variablePosition} and defined in Table \ref{table:variablePosition}.  These elements can be defined on either the plane or the surface of the sphere. The two types of cells form two meshes, a primal mesh composed of Voronoi regions and a dual mesh composed of Delaunay triangles. Each corner of a primal mesh cell is uniquely associated with the ``center'' of a dual mesh cell and vice versa. So we define the two mesh as either a primal mesh (composed of cells $P_i$) or a dual mesh (composed of cells $D_v$). The center of any primal mesh cell, $P_i$, is denoted by ${\bf x}_i$ and the center of any the dual mesh cell, $D_v$, is denoted by ${\bf x}_v$. The boundary of a given primal mesh cell $P_i$ is composed of the set of lines that connect the ${\bf x}_v$ locations of associated dual mesh cells $D_v$. Similarly, the boundary of a given dual mesh cell $D_v$ is composed of the set of lines that connect the ${\bf x}_i$ locations of the associated primal mesh cells $P_i$. 
%
As shown in Figure \ref{figure:variablePosition}, a line segment that connects two primal mesh cell centers is uniquely associated with a line segment that connects two dual mesh cell centers. We assume that these two line segments cross and the point of intersection is labeled as ${\bf x}_e$. In addition, we assume that these two line segments are orthogonal as indicated in Figure \ref{figure:variablePosition}. Each ${\bf x}_e$ is associated with two distances: $d_e$ measures the distance between the primal mesh cells sharing ${\bf x}_e$ and $l_e$ measures the distance between the dual mesh cells sharing ${\bf x}_e$.

Since the two line segments crossing at ${\bf x}_e$ are orthogonal, these line segments form a convenient local coordinate system for each edge. At each ${\bf x}_e$ location a unit vector ${\bf n}_e$ is defined to be parallel to the line connecting primal mesh cells. A second unit vector ${\bf t}_e$ is defined such that ${\bf t}_e = {\bf k} \times {\bf n}_e$.

\hline\hline
$Element$ & $Type$ & $Definition$\\
\hline
 ${\bf x}_i$   & point             & location of center of primal-mesh cells \\
 ${\bf x}_v$  &  point            & location of center of dual-mesh cells \\
 ${\bf x}_e$  & point             & location of edge points where velocity is defined \\
 $d_{e}$       & line segment & distance between neighboring ${\bf x}_i$ locations \\
 $l_{e}$       & line segment & distance between neighboring ${\bf x}_v$ locations \\
 $P_i$         & cell                 & a cell on the primal-mesh \\
 $D_v$        & cell                 & a cell on the dual-mesh \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}



Table \ref{table:gridFileName} provides the names of all {\it elements} and all {\it sets of elements} as used in the MPAS framework.  Elements appear twice in the table when described in the grid file in more than one way, e.g. points are described with both cartesian and latitude/longitude coordinates. An ``ncdump -h'' of any MPAS grid, output or restart file will contain all variable names shown in second column of Table  \ref{table:gridFileName}.


In addition to these seven element types, we require the definition of {\it sets of elements}. In all, eight different types of sets are required and these are defined and explained in Table \ref{table:gridConnectivity} and Figure \ref{figure:gridConnectivity}. The notation is always of the form of, for example, $i \in CE(e)$, where the LHS indicates the type of element to be gathered (cells) based on the RHS relation to another type of element (edges).

The angle of each edge in an MPAS grid is provided in the variable {\it angleEdge}. The angle
given is the angle between a vector pointing north and a vector pointing in the
positive tangential direction of the edge. Referring to Fig. \ref{fig:angleEdge},
\[ {\rm angleEdge} = \arcsin\|{\bf \hat n} \times {\bf \hat v}\|, \]
where ${\bf \hat n}$ is the unit vector pointing north and ${\bf \hat v}$ is the unit vector
pointing from verticesOnEdge(1,iEdge) to verticesOnEdge(2,iEdge).

Given a wind vector $(u_\perp, u_\parallel)$ defined in term of components orthogonal to
and parallel to the edge, the earth-relative wind $(u,v)$ may be recovered as
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\alpha && -\sin\alpha \\
\sin\alpha && \cos\alpha \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_\perp \\
u_\parallel \\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
where $\alpha = {\rm angleEdge}$.

\section{Vertical grid}

The vertical coordinate in MPAS-Atmosphere is $\zeta$ and has units of length, where $0 \le \zeta \le z_{t}$ and  $z_t$ is the height of the model top.  The relationship between the vertical coordinate and height in the physical domain is given as
%
\begin{equation}
z = \zeta + A\, h_s(x,y,\zeta)
\end{equation}
%\label{v_coordinate}
%
where $(x,y)$ denotes a location on the horizontal mesh and $\zeta$ is the vertical coordinate ($\zeta$ is directed radially outward from the surface of the sphere, or perpendicular to the horizontal $(x,y)$ plane in a Cartesian coordinate MPAS-A configuration).  MPAS-A can be configured with the traditional Gal-Chen and Somerville terrain-following coordinate by setting $h_s(x,y,\zeta) = h(x,y)$ and $A = 1-\zeta/z_t$, where $h(x,y)$ is the terrain height.  Alternatively, A can be modified to allow a more rapid or less rapid transition to the constant-height upper boundary condition.  Additionally, a constant-height coordinate can be specified at some intermediate height below $h_t$.

The influence of the terrain on any coordinate surface $\zeta$ can be influenced by the specification of $h_s(x,y,\zeta)$.  Specifically, $h_s$ can be set such that $h_s(x,y,0) = h(x,y)$ (i.e. terrain following at the surface), and progressively filtered fields of $h(x,y)$ can be used at $\zeta > 0$ in $h_s(x,y,\zeta)$, such that the small-scale features in the topography are quickly filtered from the coordinate.  Example MPAS-A vertical meshes are given in Figure \ref{figure:vertical_mesh}

On the MPAS-A mesh C-grid staggering, the state variables $u$, $\rho$, $\theta$ and scalars are located halfway between $w$ levels in both physical height and in the coordinate $\zeta$.  Variables associated with the coordinate systems used in the MPAS-A solver, and possibly appearing in its input, output or history files, are defined in Table \ref{table:vertical_mesh_MPAS-A} and depicted in Figure \ref{figure:vertical_coordinate}.

Further information about the vertical coordinate can be found in \hfil\break
